# Smart-Monitoring-and-Safety-System
University of Glasgow ENG5220: Real Time Embedded Programming (2024-25) Group Project
# Project Overview  

A real-time monitoring solution for **critical and non-critical environments** using **Raspberry Pi 5**.  
This system ensures **safety, surveillance, and real-time alerts** by monitoring temperature levels, motion detection and triggering alerts via active buzzer beep. 
 **Developed using:** C++, Raspberry Pi, GPIO, Fast DDS and QT.

## Features
 - **Real-time temperature monitoring** using Texas Instruments TMP117 Temperature sensors
 - **Real-time motion detection** using PIR motion sensor  
 - **Multi-threaded event handling** for optimized utilisation of system resources in real-time system  
 - **Threshold alerts with buzzer** for the consumer environment
 - **Intuitive screen display** for easy monitoring and useful to visualize different aspects of the environment easily
 - **Publish updates to subscribers** to support remote and multi-user environment 
 - **Live camera surveillance for monitoring remote environments** to be implemented in next phase 
 - **Scalable design for critical (like  Substations, NHS) & non-critical (e.g., homes, farms) use cases**

## System Architecture

### **Hardware Components**
- **Raspberry Pi 5** â€“ Central processing unit
- **Temperature Sensors** â€“ Reads environmental temperature
- **PIR motion sensor** - Reads movements
- **Buzzer** â€“ Alerts when temperature exceeds threshold ans and when motion detect
- **Camera Module** â€“ Provides live surveillance
- **LAN Interface** â€“ Transmits real-time alerts to connected client applications using real-time FAST DDS Publisher Subscriber model

### **Software Components**
- **C++ Daemon**: Periodically reads sensors data and handles event-driven actions
- **Multithreading System**: Manages parallel events in real-time
- **QT GUI**: Displays temperature information in conventional thermo view, visualize the pattern in graph view, and easy to read Time and Temperature view
- **Subscribers**: Receives temperature event notifications from main process to display the information for remote Consumers.

### **Design Scematic**
![Design Scematic](./docs/design/SystemSchematic.jpg)

## How It Works
1. **Sensors collect temperature data every second** via GPIO.
2. The **C++ daemon processes the data**, and activates event handlers.
3. Event handlers perform multiple tasks:
   - **Display temperature information on the screen**
   - **Trigger a buzzer alarm when threshold exceeds**
   - **Publish notifications to Subscribers**
   - **Start live video surveillance (if enabled)**
4. **Users can remotely monitor sensor readings and alerts via LAN-connected apps.**
5. The system operates autonomously with **minimal latency** using a **multi-threaded architecture**.
