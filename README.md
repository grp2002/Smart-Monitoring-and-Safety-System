# Smart-Monitoring-and-Safety-System
University of Glasgow ENG5220: Real Time Embedded Programming (2024-25) Group Project
# Project Overview  

A real-time monitoring solution for **critical and non-critical environments** using **Raspberry Pi 5**.  
This system ensures **safety, surveillance, and real-time alerts** by monitoring temperature levels and triggering alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
 **Developed using:** C++, Raspberry Pi GPIO, LAN-based communication, and a Camera surveillance module.

## Features
 **Real-time temperature monitoring** using Raspberry Pi sensors  
 **Multi-threaded event handling** for real-time responsiveness  
 **Threshold alerts with buzzer, screen display, and LAN updates**  
 **Live camera surveillance for monitoring remote environments**  
  **Scalable design for critical ( like  substations) & non-critical (e.g., homes, farms) use cases**

## System Architecture

### **Hardware Components**
- **Raspberry Pi 5** â€“ Central processing unit
- **Temperature Sensors** â€“ Reads environmental temperature
- **Buzzer** â€“ Alerts when temperature exceeds threshold ans and when motion detect
- **Camera Module** â€“ Provides live surveillance
- **LAN Interface** â€“ Transmits real-time alerts to connected client applications

### **Software Components**
- **C++ Daemon**: Periodically reads sensor data and handles event-driven actions
- **Multithreading System**: Manages different events in real-time
- **Web Interface (GitHub Pages)**: Displays project details and status updates
- **Client Applications (LAN-Based)**: Receives alerts and displays monitoring data

### **Design Scematic**

## How It Works
1. **Sensors collect temperature data every 5 minutes** via GPIO.
2. The **C++ daemon processes the data** and activates event handlers based on threshold conditions.
3. Event handlers perform multiple tasks:
   - **Display alert messages on screen**
   - **Trigger a buzzer alarm**
   - **Send alerts to LAN-connected client applications**
   - **Start live video surveillance (if enabled)**
4. **Users can remotely monitor sensor readings and alerts via LAN-connected apps.**
5. The system operates autonomously with **minimal latency** using a **multi-threaded architecture**.
